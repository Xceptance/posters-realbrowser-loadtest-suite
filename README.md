# Real Browser Performance Test Suite for Posters

This repository is an example of a real browser test suite for load testing with [XLT](https://www.xceptance.com/xlt/). In comparison to the [advanced posters loadtest suite](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-advanced-loadtest-suite), this suite uses a real browser testing approach utilizing Selenide and XLT.

To learn all about the basic feature set around configuration and data, refer to the [advanced posters loadtest suite](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-advanced-loadtest-suite). The following documentation will only highlight the difference when running real browser load tests.

The test suite is ready to be executed against the Posters demo store [Posters](https://posters.xceptance.io:8443/). Please note, this setup is for testing purposes only and does not handle a lot of load. Please setup your [own copy of the Posters demo store](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-demo-store) if you want to experiment with executions of higher load factors and more complex test configurations.
