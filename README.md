# Real Browser Performance Test Suite for Posters

This repository is an example of a real browser test suite for load testing with [XLT](https://www.xceptance.com/xlt/). In comparison to the [advanced posters loadtest suite](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-advanced-loadtest-suite), this suite uses a real browser testing approach utilizing Selenide and XLT.

To learn all about the basic feature set around configuration and data, refer to the [advanced posters loadtest suite](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-advanced-loadtest-suite). The following documentation will only highlight the difference when running real browser load tests.

**Advantages**

**Disadvantages**

## Demo Store
This test suite is built against version 1 of the [Posters Demo Store](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-demo-store). You can easily see that, because that is the more grayish storefront. Version 2 has a restyled more modern one, mostly featuring a redish color scheme. Make sure you use the right version when testing.
